         Good seminar which helped to see where we stand and what stands before us. Got some interesting info on the Molecular Identifier and Barcode in the BLISS
          protocol that these are usually used in the peak calling protocols as well. What we understood from Simon they are not needed for us as splitting of the samples
          and normalization has already been done. We are however checking this with Simon.<br><br>
          I have run MACS2 peak calling for the trimmed dataset and Weilong will be doing summary and descriptive statistics of the result before the meeting tomorrow.
          <br> We do have some concern about RNA 3' adapter contamination (as per the FastQC report) but after discussion with Lars we will start to run the trimmed
          dataset and see where that leaves us. Depending on the result and time this is otherwise a good step for improving the pipeline, at least confirming there is or isn't
          a change by cutting the (possibly) contaminated reads out.<br><br>
          Another aspect is to not overdo the pipeline. We are now running mapping with bwa-mem, bwa-aln and bowtie2 as these three are the main once for Illumina sequenced short (less than 100bp) single reads.
          Jing will be compare the bwa-aln and bwa-mem mapping to see what the difference is. With the short reads we have (60 bp) there will most likely not be any difference between mem/aln, or so our 
          experience tells us.<br><br>
          Leonard will be starting the poster work so we have a template as soon as we have more data, better early than late, and I will be expanding on our pipeline. The main thing now is to get the pipeline fully automated so we can run it quickly
          and to test the tools we have. <br>
          Apart from the mappers we are also looking at the peak callers, at present we hace run MACS2 as we have experience in it but we will also try Homer(findPeaks) as this is one of the for front tools. However, I need to inventories Uppmax and
          see what tools are easily available.

         Built a small pipeline for the peak calling using MACS2. Running it as we speak(read). <br>
          We also got the G4Q-complex locations BED files from Simon so can use those to see if there is any correlation between the
          peaks and G4Q-location. Will be interesting to see if there are any correlations.<br><br>
          We need to have a serious talk in the group today about the work that is done and delegation. We need to have all data ready 
          before the christmas break and people needs to step up and start prioritizing this project if we are to complete it in time.

         A full pipeline is set up and documented (commands.txt in the project root folder on Uppmax). This will take the (trimmed and quality checked) files
          and map (to .sai with bwa aln or .sam with bwa mem) and then convert/index/sort etc into .bed files ready for MACS and/or viewing.<br><br>
          Seminar tomorrow, questions we need to discuss/talk to Lars about:
          <ul>
            <li>Preprocessing steps, have we missed something? RNA 3' adapters cleaning?</li>
            <li>Statistics, any idea of tests to explore?</li>
            <li>Tools pipeline, bwa aln/mem, samtools and MACS.</li>
            <li>Scope of project</li>
          </ul>

        <h3><a id="six-entry" class="anchor" href="#six-entry" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2016-12-05 Project plan and QC</h3>
          Good check up meeting. Clear path on what we all have to do for this week.<br><br>
          I trimmed the fastq files for the beginning MI and barcode, 16 bases, and ran fastqc again. Instantly looks better. However we seem to have som 3' Illumina
          adapter contamination. Leonard and I went through and checked and found the exact sequence. We will do some research on <i>cutadapt</i> to 
          remove them.<br><br>
          I am rerunning the mapping against the trimmed files, most likely using <b>bwa aln</b> instead of <b>bwa mem</b> as the sequences
          now are down to 60 bp. Will be interesting to see what happens with RNA primer purging.<br><br>
          Looking into peak calling, in the middle of a small script to make sure all the files are in proper format (bed) for MACS (and looking at
          least one more tool). Jing will ask Simon for the bed-files that indentifies the G4Q sites so we can correlate.<br><br>
          The updated project goal: <i>Are there a significant increase in DBS between the wildtype and knockout samples? Are these breaks correlated to the known G4Q sites?</i>
          <br><br>
          We need to get Lars input on the statistics on Wednesday, what would be the best approach to calculate the confidance given so few samples?
          </p>

          Sorted the mm10 mouse reference. The full one came in 2bit format so have done some conversion (straight forward) into .fa format.
          Built script and run the index (bwa) on the reference, reside in the data folder. Have also got a script up and running for alignment with bwa-mem (default parameters).
          Simple support for running all 5 samples in parallel. 
          <br><br>
          Went through the fastqc result and there are some question marks. Specifically 3'-adapters in the latter part of the reads and som
          strange nucleotide spreading in the first 3rd. We also have to look for the Molecular Identifier and Barcode patterns. Remember they are both
          8 base pairs long and the Barcode always ends with a C. Should be easy to run some quick statistics to verify the 4 diff positions (pos 8, 16 and -8 and -16). 
          <br><br>
          Meeting tomorrow at 1300. We need to have all quality questions sorted this week and preferably a full pipeline for the analysis done so we quickly can run everything through.

<a id="fourth-entry" class="anchor" href="#fourth-entry" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2016-12-02 Scripts</h3>

<p> Done some quick scripting on Uppmax. We have around 15-22 million reads in each file (with each read being 76bp, have to confirm this is the case for all samples).
  <ul id="sample_list">
    <li>H3.3 Wildtype   21,079,172 reads</li>
    <li>H3.3 KO         16,330,970 reads</li>
    <br>
    <li>WT26 Wildtype   12,773,603 reads</li>
    <li>ATRX KO         24,615,902 reads</li>
    <li>DAXX KO         11,603,719 reads</li>
  </ul>

  We had a good meeting with Simon and have updated our research question. <br>
          <i> How many significant Double Stranded Breaks (peaks) is there in the KO samples compared to its respective wildtype (adjust for "freak peaks" by comparing the samples 
          against a paired-end sequencing of genomic DNA from wildtype ES cells at <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM1555118">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM1555118</a>)
          and do these peaks (DSB) correspond to known location of the G4Q-complex? G4Q-complex in coding regions or non-coding regions?</i>
<br>Upcoming group meetings:
    <ul>
      <li>Monday 5th Dec, 13:00, Pluto Alpha 4</li>
      <li>Thursday 8th Dec, 10:00, Kinnekulle Alpha 5</li>
          </ul>

<a id="third-entry" class="anchor" href="#third-entry" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2016-12-01 Start the pipeline</h3>

<p>Project structure set up on Uppmax. A simple straight forward version, might be we set up a repo for the code so we all can share it 
  easily.<br>
  Trello set up for us all and a board each for both the pipeline work and the initial research started</p>
<p>Done some research on the initial pipeline. With the mouse genom being almost 3GB long (2.8x10^9) we need to choose an aligner suited for longer genomes. BWA-mem is a good
  fallback but SHRiMP2 and Novoalign seems like interesting options, especially SHRiMP2 which does not need indexing. Bowtie2 and STAR should also be
  in the run, requires quite a lot of ram (30+GB) but should not be a problem on Uppmax. <br>
  No requirement for splicing though which simplifies the alignment. Will be interesting to see what Simon says tomorrow. Might
  be he already has a pipeline in mind. Always easier to use what the group is already using.

<a id="second-entry" class="anchor" href="#second-entry" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2016-11-30 Runthrough of project</h3>

<p>First seminar and runthrough of the project. I will set up a structure on Uppmax for us to use for code/data. </p>
          <p>As there are a lot of questions about the projects, specifically 
  what exact biological question we should focus on in this project, we have decided to book in a meeting with Jings supervisor (Simon Elsässer) to both get a good understanding
          of the new BLISS method and to get more information on what has been done previously (both using BLESS and BLISS). UPDATE! Meeting set for 1100 on friday 2 Dec.</p>

<a id="first-entry" class="anchor" href="#first-entry" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2016-11-29 Start of project</h3>

<p>This will be the project diary for the BB2491 project HT2016. Blog set up and data moved to Uppmax. All five(5) files reside at /proj/g2016025/Grp4Prj/BLISS/. 
          We have to look closer at the specifics. Each sample has only been run once and the Double Stranded Breaks (DSB) has been luminecently tagged. Will 
          be interesting to see how this presents itself in they data.</p>
          <p>Must have a closer look at the statistic approach. Without multi run per sample we need to make sure the statistics are valid and we run the right tests.</p>
