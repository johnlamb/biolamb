<p>Project structure set up on Uppmax. A simple straight forward version, might be we set up a repo for the code so we all can share it 
  easily.<br>
  Trello set up for us all and a board each for both the pipeline work and the initial research started</p>
<p>Done some research on the initial pipeline. With the mouse genom being almost 3GB long (2.8x10^9) we need to choose an aligner suited for longer genomes. BWA-mem is a good
  fallback but SHRiMP2 and Novoalign seems like interesting options, especially SHRiMP2 which does not need indexing. Will be interesting to see what Simon says tomorrow. Might
  be her already has a pipeline in mind. Always easier to use what the group is already using.

<a id="second-entry" class="anchor" href="#second-entry" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2016-11-30 Runthrough of project</h3>

<p>First seminar and runthrough of the project. I will set up a structure on Uppmax for us to use for code/data. </p>
          <p>As there are a lot of questions about the projects, specifically 
  what exact biological question we should focus on in this project, we have decided to book in a meeting with Jings supervisor (Simon Elsässer) to both get a good understanding
          of the new BLISS method and to get more information on what has been done previously (both using BLESS and BLISS). UPDATE! Meeting set for 1100 on friday 2 Dec.</p>

<p>This will be the project diary for the BB2491 project HT2016. Blog set up and data moved to Uppmax. All five(5) files reside at /proj/g2016025/Grp4Prj/BLISS/. 
          We have to look closer at the specifics. Each sample has only been run once and the Double Stranded Breaks (DSB) has been luminecently tagged. Will 
          be interesting to see how this presents itself in they data.</p>
          <p>Must have a closer look at the statistic approach. Without multi run per sample we need to make sure the statistics are valid and we run the right tests.</p>
