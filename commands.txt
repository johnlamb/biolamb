##### PIPELINE #####
With an indexed reference genome (both mm10.index.sh and samIndex.sh) and cleaned
fastq files (trimImandBarcode.sh and having checked the quality with FastQC) the pipeline is as follows:

1.	Run alignment, if bwa mem, jump to 3.
2.	Convert .sai to .sam using convertSaiToSam.sh, check the scripts for right files
3.	Convert .sam to .bam, sort and index each file and convert to .bed. All using samToBamToBed.sh
4. 	These .bed files are now ready for MACS or viewing.
5. 	mm10.peak.se will run MACS2 peak calling on .sam files. Outputs in a separate directory under output
